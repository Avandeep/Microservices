Factors:-

URI and Request Parameter versioning:- actual polluting the URI space 
(creating URI and new request parameters), cache them because it is part of URI;
can execute on normal browser; here, documentation is little easy.

Media type and Custom headers versioning:- not polluting the URI space, http headers are
never intended for versioning, use headers to differentiate between requests,
caching is never come into picture, caching is becoming difficult here; cannot execute on
normal browser; need plug-in to run; here, documentation might be difficult.
